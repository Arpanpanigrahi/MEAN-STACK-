    <p>I am Arpan Panigrahi, I am born and raised in Mumbai, and currently I am pursuing B.TECH in CSE, from SILICON INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY, BHUBANESWAR, with an aggregate of  90% till the eight semester. 
       Talking about my family, my family consists of four members including me and my younger sister. My father is station manager in Indian railways and mother is a housewife.
       My hobbies include sketching and playing cricket. I played at cluster level at school and university level at college.
       Coming to my strengths and weaknesses, my strengths are. I am a good learner, innovative, I have positive attitude and committed to my work. My weakness is procrastination and I am a bit selfish too.
       My ultimate goal is to do work what I like to do and your company can provide me that opportunity.
       That's all about myself, my quote is "Life is all about grabbing the opportunity". thank you so much for giving me the opportunity to introduce me.</p>
